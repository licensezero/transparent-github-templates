# Transparent GitHub Templates

GitHub pull request and issue templates bringing important commercial context to light.

Too many times, open software developers and users alike miss opportunities, and create misunderstanding, because platforms like GitHub intentionally omit information about commercial context.  These pull request and issue templates give you a starting point for systematically making that context clear in day-to-day project work.

For an idea of how issues and pull request often go wrong without this information, see the first few paragraphs of [this blog post](https://blog.licensezero.com/2017/10/16/mercenary-rapport.html).
